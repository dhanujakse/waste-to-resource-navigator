# Circular AI Demo Video Script

## ET Gen AI Hackathon 2026 - Demo Presentation

### Duration: 3 minutes

---

## Scene 1: Problem Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)
**Visual**: Split screen showing waste dumps and recycling centers in India

**Narrator**: 
"India generates over 62 million tonnes of waste annually, with only 28% being processed effectively. The challenge lies in identifying waste types correctly, ensuring regulatory compliance, and connecting waste generators with appropriate recyclers. Today, we present Circular AI - bridging waste generation and resource recovery using multimodal generative AI."

**On-screen text**: 
"62M tonnes annual waste • 28% processed • 72% unmanaged"

## Scene 2: Product Overview (0:30 - 0:45)
**Visual**: App interface showing the main screen

**Narrator**: 
"Circular AI is a multimodal waste-to-resource navigator that uses GPT-4o Vision to identify waste materials, checks compliance with CPCB 2016 rules, and connects users with local recyclers offering real-time pricing."

**On-screen text**: 
"Multimodal GenAI • CPCB Compliant • Local Recycler Network"

## Scene 3: Safe Material Flow - PET Bottle (0:45 - 1:30)
**Visual**: 
1. User uploading PET bottle image
2. AI analysis happening
3. Results showing "PET Plastic - 95% confidence"
4. Green safety indicator appearing
5. CPCB guidelines for PET disposal
6. Local recyclers with ₹45/kg pricing

**Narrator**: 
"Let's demonstrate with a PET bottle. Our GPT-4o Vision analyzes the image and identifies it as PET plastic with 95% confidence. The safety agent confirms it's safe for recycling, triggering green indicators. The system retrieves relevant CPCB disposal guidelines and shows local recyclers offering ₹45 per kg for PET materials."

**Key Points Highlighted**:
- Accurate material identification
- Real-time safety assessment
- Regulatory compliance information
- Live pricing data

## Scene 4: Hazardous Material Flow - Chemical Container (1:30 - 2:15)
**Visual**: 
1. User uploading chemical container image
2. AI detecting hazardous material
3. Red alert safety indicator
4. Emergency protocols display
5. Connection to hazardous waste specialists

**Narrator**: 
"Now, let's see the safety-first design. When we upload a chemical container, the system immediately identifies it as hazardous material, triggers a red alert, displays emergency handling protocols, and connects to specialized hazardous waste management facilities. This ensures worker safety and regulatory compliance."

**Key Points Highlighted**:
- Automatic hazardous detection
- Safety protocol activation
- Specialist connection
- Regulatory compliance

## Scene 5: EPR Compliance Dashboard (2:15 - 2:45)
**Visual**: 
1. Navigation to EPR dashboard
2. Recovery rate metrics
3. Compliance tracking charts
4. Reporting interface

**Narrator**: 
"For businesses, our EPR compliance dashboard tracks Extended Producer Responsibility metrics, monitors recovery targets, and generates regulatory reports. This helps companies meet their environmental obligations under CPCB guidelines."

**Key Points Highlighted**:
- EPR tracking
- Compliance metrics
- Regulatory reporting
- Business intelligence

## Scene 6: India-First Features (2:45 - 3:00)
**Visual**: 
1. Hindi/English language toggle
2. Indian city locations
3. CPCB 2016 rules interface
4. Mobile-responsive design

**Narrator**: 
"Our India-first approach includes Hindi/English bilingual support, focus on CPCB 2016 regulations, and coverage of major Indian cities. Circular AI transforms waste management for a sustainable Bharat."

**Closing Text Overlay**: 
"Circular AI • Bridging Waste & Resources • Made for India"
